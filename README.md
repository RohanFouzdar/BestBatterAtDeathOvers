# BestBatterAtDeathOvers
Analyzing the best batters at IPL till IPL 2022 and finding the approach that works best.

Some brilliant insights have come our way.

Well, if you wanted proof that AB De Villiers is an outlier, an alien, here's it. He has mastered the art of maintaining high averages and high strike rates at the death. Death overs are the time where it's a general idea that you've to trade-off either of the average or the strike rate to hold on to your way of play.

The seasoned group of finishers cluster themselves - Hardik Pandya, Kieron Pollard, David Miller, MS. The ones who take the game deep and see. They are 'masters of what to trade-off at what point of chase'. Sometimes they enter and go blitzkrieg, while sometimes they take the game deep and deep.

Also, the unusual cases of Andre Russell and Ravindra Jadeja - so unique to visualize. Their approach to pressure can visualized so well. Jadeja doesn't give the wicket away no matter how things go, while on the other hand, Russell plays at the edge of the sword.
